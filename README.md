# Image Enhancement

This repository contains Python programs with graphical user interfaces (GUI) for solving the following problems:

**Mapping Equations (Linear and Non-linear)**

**Digital Negative**

**Histogram Stretch and Shrink**

## Techniques Implemented
### Digital Negative
The Digital_Negative program takes an input image from the user and generates its digital negative.

### Histogram Stretch and Shrink
The Histogram_Spread program takes an input image from the user and performs histogram stretching. It stretches the range of pixel values in the image to improve contrast and enhance details.

The Histogram_Shrink program takes an input image from the user and performs histogram shrinking. It compresses the range of pixel values in the image to reduce contrast and emphasize specific details.

### Intensity Level Transformation
The Intensity_Level_transformation program allows users to adjust the intensity levels of an input image. It provides options to increase or decrease the brightness and contrastof the image.

### Piecewise Transformation
The PieceWise_Transformation program allows users to apply a piecewise transformation to an input image. They can define multiple segments with different intensity mapping functions to selectively modify the image.

### Power Law Transformation
The power_law_transformation program applies a power law transformation to an input image. It allows users to adjust the gamma value to control the image's contrast and brightness.

### Usage
To use these programs, run the respective Python files and follow the instructions provided by the GUI. Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed, such as matplotlib, PyQt5, numpy, copy and CV2.

Feel free to explore the source code of each program and customize them to suit your specific needs.
